# React + Redux list of posts

You have the already implemented
[Dynamic list of posts](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_dynamic-list-of-posts#react_dynamic-list-of-posts)
and the `Counter` example of Redux Toolkit usage.

> Here is the [working DEMO](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_redux-list-of-posts/)

Learn the implemented App and the example and reimplement it with Redux having the next slice:
- `users` and remove `UsersContext`;
- `author` that is currently in the `App`;
- `posts` having 3 props `loaded`, `hasError` and `items`;
- `selectedPost`;
- `comments` with `loaded`, `hasError` and `items` props (keep the `visible` in the `PostDetails`);
- `NewCommentForm` should keep its state.
